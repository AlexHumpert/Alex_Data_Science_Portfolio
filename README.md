# [Project 1: Python - Forest Cover Type Prediction Challenge, Multiclass Classification](https://github.com/AlexHumpert/Forest_Cover_Type_Prediction_Competition)

Term 2 group project for Machine Learning 2 class at IE university - part of the Masters in Business Analytics and Big Data program.

Predicted forest cover type through an ensemble model of Random Forest and Extra Trees classifiers trained on expanded feature set with Python â€“ achieved average 79.7% accuracy (89th percentile Kaggle competition ranking).

Applied data-centric approach to improve model accuracy by conducting feature expansion (averaging and summing numerical features) and feature reduction (reverse hot-encoding dummy variables and normalizing numerical features to conduct principal component analysis).
